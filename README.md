# NodeGui Webview plugin - QT6 [WIP]

This is a modified version of the original NodeGui Webview plugin example, updated to work with QT 6.4.1.
I don't really know much about QT, C/C++ build chains, etcetera, but I think I do know enough to make this work for me.
The current version is a little hacky here and there, but it compiles and runs for me on Windows. Next step is figuring out how to use it in another project.
Any suggestions are welcome.

----------------

Start with `demo.ts` to understand how it all works.

More details soon.
